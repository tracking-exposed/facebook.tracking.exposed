This project started in 2016 by [Claudio Agosti](https://linktr.ee/claudio.agosti), with crucial technical support at the early stage from [Alberto Granzotto](https://www.granzotto.net/); In the years it expanded to become the first generalized toolkit for adversarial algorithm accountability known as [Tracking Exposed](https://tracking.exposed).

facebook.tracking.exposed (fbtrex) **was the first worldwide data donation** project, enabled pioneering researches and inspired many other organisations to replicate the approach. It was also **fundamental in the first sock-puppet algorithm analysis** in Facebook, recording evidences and patterns only explained by whistleblowers years later. 

The main challenge was **resist the anti-scraping techniques implemented by Facebook**, but the design was solid enough to resist for 5 years, resilience is possible, at a cost.

fbtrex was the skeleton upon which was build the equivalent system to analyze [YouTube (in 2018)](https://youtube.tracking.exposed), [PornHub (in 2019)](https://pornhub.tracking.exposed), [Amazon (in 2019)](https://amazon.tracking.exposed) and [TikTok (in 2020)](https://tiktok.tracking.exposed). The software was always published in AGPL-3 license on [git](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/facebook), but it stopped being maintained at the end of 2021, when the [Tracking Exposed](https://tracking.exposed) project will start a refocusing movement, and in 2023 become [AI Forensics](https://aiforensics.org). Below a list of resources produced by researchers using the tool.

## 2019

* at Transmediale [Affects Ex-Machina: Unboxing Social Data Algorithms](https://vimeo.com/322250610) Conventional media have long filtered information and influenced public opinion. In the age of social media, this process has become algorithmic and targeted, separating the whole of society into thousands of small filter bubbles that construct collective orientations and pilot viral phenomena. This panel examines how machine learning and obscure algorithms analyze and manipulate individual affects into political sentiments, eventually amplifying class, gender, and racial bias ― with Claudio Agosti, Ariana Dongus, Nayantara Ranganathan, Caroline Sinders. Organized by KIM | HfG Karlsruhe. ([site](https://transmediale.de/content/affects-ex-machina-unboxing-social-data-algorithms"))

* at EDPS [How to unmask and fight online manipulation](https://www.eudebates.tv/eu_elections_2019/edps-for-eu-elections-how-to-unmask-and-fight-online-manipulation/) Organized by the working group against misinformation. We highlight how research can use it and assess proper responsibilities to the actors in the misinformation chain. Platform are not neutral, we were looking how algorithm affects the information flows.
  
* at CPDP [Safeguarding elections an international problem with no international solution](https://vimeo.com/317686100) a roundtable Coordinated by TacticalTech. ― There is a growing body of research into data-driven elections world-wide and the international nature of the data and elections industry has been highlighted: from international platforms, to strategists in one country advising political groups in another, to paid targeted ads across borders. ― Ailidh Callander, Claudio Agosti, Paul Bernal, Victoria Peuvrelle" ([conference website](https://www.cpdpconferences.org/cpdp-panels/data-and-elections-an-international-problem-with-no-international-solution))
  
* at PrivacyCamp [Towards real safeguards: Data driven political campaigns and EU election](https://privacycamp.eu/?page_id=1067). This panel aims to evaluate potential preventive mechanisms such as Facebook algorithmic transparency around online political targeting, EU Commission’s Action Plan against Disinformation, awareness raising on current and future campaigning practices, as well as efforts to protect media pluralism and freedom. ―  With Fanny Hidvegi, Elda Brogi, Claudio Agosti, Josh Smith and Eleonora Nestola
